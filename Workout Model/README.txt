There are two html files, makeAndTrainModelLaptop and trainLaptop and three javascript files, makeModelLaptop.js, trainer.js(in js folder) and trainLaptop.js are used particularly for the model training and deployment. Model is made by laptop camera recording which starts few seconds after pressing alphabet keys in the keyboard. After 'S' is pressed no further models are recorded. Then trainer.js will use the exercise model (downloaded in JSON format) to train the computer. Then the two files downloaded will be used in the trainLaptop.js to deploy the trained model.
